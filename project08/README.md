# Project 8: Loops and RPS V2

This project contains two Python scripts. One demonstrates various types of loops in Python (while and for loops), and the other is an improved version of the Rock, Paper, Scissors game that allows the user to play again.

## Files
- `loops.py`: A script demonstrating `while` and `for` loops, `break`, `continue`, and `else` clauses with loops.
- `rps2.py`: A command-line Rock, Paper, Scissors game that loops to allow multiple playthroughs.

To run the scripts, use the following commands:
```bash
python project08/loops.py
python project08/rps2.py
```
