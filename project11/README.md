# Project 11: Scope and RPS v4

This project contains two Python scripts. One demonstrates variable scope in Python (global, local, and nonlocal), and the other is an updated version of the Rock, Paper, Scissors game that includes a nested function and a global game counter.

## Files
- `scope.py`: A script that demonstrates global, local, and nonlocal variable scopes.
- `rps4.py`: A command-line Rock, Paper, Scissors game that uses a nested function to decide the winner and tracks the number of games played using a global variable.

To run the scripts, use the following commands:
```bash
python project11/scope.py
python project11/rps4.py
```
