# Project 10: Recursion, Loops, and RPS v3

This project contains three Python scripts that demonstrate recursion, a `while` loop with `break` and `continue`, and an updated version of the Rock, Paper, Scissors game that uses recursion for the main game loop.

## Files
- `recursion.py`: A script that demonstrates a simple recursive function.
- `example.py`: A script that shows a `while` loop with `break` and `continue` statements.
- `rps3.py`: A command-line Rock, Paper, Scissors game that uses a recursive function to allow the user to play again.

To run the scripts, use the following commands:
```bash
python project10/recursion.py
python project10/example.py
python project10/rps3.py
```
